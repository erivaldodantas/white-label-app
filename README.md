# White Label App
The idea is to have one react native app for multiple application 
with the same functional, but has slightly different things, e.g.: theme color, font or logo.

## How to run

### To run `Red` version of the App
```sh
app=red-app npm start
```
It will open the app with red background and `Red App` text.

### To run `Blue` version of the App

```sh
app=blue-app npm start
```
It will open the app with blue background and `Blue App` text.
